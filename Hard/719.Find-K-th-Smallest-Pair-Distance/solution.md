# Intuition

To solve the problem of finding the k-th smallest pair distance in an array, we can use a combination of binary search and a sliding window approach. The key insight is that the problem can be framed as a search for the smallest possible distance such that at least `k` pairs have this distance or smaller.

# Approach: Binary Search + Sliding Window

This approach uses binary search on the possible distances and a sliding window to count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to a given value. The binary search allows us to efficiently zero in on the k-th smallest distance.

## Explanation:

1. **Sorting the Array**:

   - Start by sorting the array `nums`. This allows us to use the sliding window technique effectively.
   - Sorting ensures that the difference between consecutive elements is minimized, which helps in counting pairs with smaller distances first.

2. **Binary Search on Distance**:

   - We use binary search to find the k-th smallest distance. The search range is from `left = 0` (the smallest possible distance) to `right = max(nums) - min(nums)` (the largest possible distance).

3. **Sliding Window to Count Pairs**:

   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, we use the `sliding` function to count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to `mid`.
   - The `sliding` function uses two pointers (`left` and `right`) to maintain a window where the difference between `nums[right]` and `nums[left]` is less than or equal to `mid`. If the difference exceeds `mid`, the `left` pointer is incremented.
   - The number of valid pairs for a given `right` index is `right - left`, which is added to a running `count`.

4. **Adjusting the Binary Search Range**:

   - If the number of pairs with distance less than or equal to `mid` is less than `k`, it means we need to search for a larger distance, so `left` is adjusted to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we search for a smaller distance by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - The binary search terminates when `left` equals the smallest distance that satisfies the condition of having at least `k` pairs, so `left` is returned as the k-th smallest distance.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n \log d + n \log n)$, where $d$ is the range of the possible distances and $n$ is the size of the array.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$, as we only use a few additional variables for the binary search and sliding window.

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sliding(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size(), count = 0;

        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            while (nums[right] - nums[left] > target) {
                ++left;
            }

            count += right - left;
        }

        return count;
    }

    int smallestDistancePair(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        ranges::sort(nums);

        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.back() - nums[0];
        int mid;

        while (left <= right) {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (sliding(nums, mid) < k) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)

        def sliding(target: int) -> int:
            count, left, right = 0, 0, 0

            while right < n:
                while nums[right] - nums[left] > target:
                    left += 1
                count += right - left
                right += 1

            return count


        left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if sliding(mid) < k:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        return left

### JavaScript

```js
let sliding = function(nums, target) {
    let count = 0;

    for (let left = 0, right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        while (nums[right] - nums[left] > target) {
            ++left;
        }

        count += right - left;
    }

    return count;
};

let smallestDistancePair = function(nums, k) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0;
    let right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];
    let mid;

    while (left <= right) {
        mid = (left + right) >>> 1;

        if (sliding(nums, mid) < k) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
};
