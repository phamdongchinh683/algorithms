# Intuition
1. Max Bitwise AND: The maximum bitwise AND will always involve the largest number in the array (or numbers equal to it), since any bitwise AND operation with a smaller number will result in a smaller or equal value.
2. Longest Subarray: Once we find the maximum element in the array, we need to find the longest contiguous subarray consisting only of this element to ensure the bitwise AND remains maximum.

# Approach
1. Traverse the array and keep track of the maximum element seen so far (`currMax`).
2. If we find an element larger than `currMax`, update `currMax`, reset the size of the current subarray to 1, and reset the result.
3. If we find another element equal to `currMax`, increase the size of the subarray and update the result to reflect the longest subarray of the maximum element.
4. If the element is smaller than `currMax`, reset the size to 0 since the subarray is broken.
5. Return the result at the end of the traversal.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  The solution involves a single pass over the array, so the time complexity is $O(n)$ where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.

- **Space complexity:**  
  The space complexity is $O(1)$ because only a few integer variables are used for tracking state.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int currMax = 0;
        int res = 0;
        int size = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > currMax) {
                currMax = num;
                size = 1;
                res = 1;  
            } else if (num == currMax) {
                size++;
                res = Math.max(res, size);
            } else {
                size = 0;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
